# Welcome

This is a page dedicated to my ongoing journey with coding and my pursuit of an MSBA at The College of William and Mary.

## With great coding comes great responsibility...

> “Remember there’s no such thing as a small act of kindness. Every act creates a ripple with no logical end.” —Scott Adams

> Ultimately I hope to take my knowledge of coding and use it to protect the vulnerable from those who would use their skills to do harm. I particularly hope to focus on fighting human trafficking.
